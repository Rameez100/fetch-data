1. We have so many options to call API, in this excercise I used Fetch API to load the Response. I also used jQuery to do the same thing, you can see that in the commented lines. Both Fetch API, jQuery calls will work.
2. I used bootstrap, handlebars CDN's in index.html
3. Created SCSS file and compiled it to CSS using node-sass.
